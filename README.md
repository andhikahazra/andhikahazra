## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to My GitHub Profile! ðŸš€

My name is Andhika Hazra, and I am currently a second-semester student at the University of Technology Yogyakarta, majoring in Informatics in the Faculty of Science and Technology. I have a strong passion for web development, and I am excited to share my journey and projects with you here on GitHub.

As an aspiring web developer, I am constantly learning and exploring new technologies and methodologies to enhance my skills. My primary focus is on creating user-friendly, efficient, and aesthetically pleasing web applications. I believe that a well-designed website can make a significant impact, and I strive to bring innovative ideas to life through my work.

On my GitHub, you will find a collection of my projects, ranging from simple web pages to more complex web applications. Each project represents a step in my learning journey, and I am always looking forward to improving and expanding my knowledge.

Feel free to explore my repositories, give feedback, or even collaborate on a project. I am open to connecting with like-minded individuals and professionals who share a passion for web development.

Thank you for visiting my profile! Let's code and create something amazing together. ðŸŒŸ
